                    The Bass Offshore Wind Energy project (BOWE) is a transformational renewable energy project that
                    will help accelerate Australia’s change to a green and clean energy supply.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The project will design, construct and operate a large-scale wind farm in Commonwealth waters 30
                    kilometres off the coast of north-eastern Tasmania, taking advantage of Tasmania’s world-class
                    offshore wind resources.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    BOWE will redefine what it means to give back, with between 35 and 70 offshore wind turbines
                    generating up to 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy, potentially powering up to 325,000 homes with
                    zero emissions – and saving 2 million tonnes of CO2 annually.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The project will support Australia’s transition to a zero-carbon economy, and will confirm
                    Tasmania’s status as a global renewable energy powerhouse, while also supporting the Tasmanian
                    Government’s global leading target of 200% renewable energy.

                                    team has been working on the design and delivery of this project and is set to start
                                    the regulatory licencing process. Subject to necessary approvals, BOWE is expected
                                    to come online from 2026.

                    <h3>Bass Offshore Wind Energy project set to power Australia’s energy transition</h3>
                    <p>
                        As Australians increasingly call for the transition to a clean energy economy, emerging company
                        Nexsphere (previously known as Brookvale Energy), has today announced its intention to develop
                        the Bass Offshore Wind Energy project (BOWE).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Located off the coast of north-eastern Tasmania, BOWE is a multi-billion-dollar offshore wind
                        farm that is set to make good use of the opportunities offered by the world-class offshore wind
                        resource in the Bass Strait.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The BOWE windfarm will generate between 500-1,000 megawatts of renewable energy, enough to power
                        over 325,000 homes and will assist in transitioning Australia’s grid to a low carbon future.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a result, the BOWE windfarm will reduce over 2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions
                        annually, contributing to Australia’s net zero emissions by 2050 and Tasmania’s 200% renewable
                        energy by 2040 targets.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        BOWE will provide and foster job creation and education, and massively boost spending in the
                        local and State economies during its 40+ year life.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Nexsphere CEO Glen Kierse said, “We’re committed to developing BOWE for the benefit of Tasmania.
                        It will provide enormous long-term employment and investment opportunities and deliver
                        significant growth for the State.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “The strength of offshore wind in Bass Strait is well known. Globally, offshore wind is a
                        significant and growing part of the future for renewable energy. With BOWE, Tasmania can deliver
                        major green energy solutions to its people and businesses, as well as position itself to export
                        green energy to the mainland,” he added.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        According to Mr Kierse, the project will be a key driver in helping Australia achieve a net
                        carbon neutral position.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Renewable energy and climate goals are taking priority overseas, and it’s an inevitable next
                        step in Australia as well, especially as there is an increasing shift in the Australian psyche
                        that is seeking action on climate change,” he explained.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “With this in mind, BOWE will drive the discussion around green energy, and ultimately play a
                        big role in helping Australia reach a net carbon neutral target in the foreseeable future.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Further announcements regarding timelines and development, including strategic and capital
                        partners, will be made in the coming weeks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Nexsphere will seek to engage with local Tasmanian communities and businesses during the design,
                        licensing, construction, and operation phases of the BOWE project.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Nexsphere team is working closely with the Tasmanian Government to ensure the project aligns
                        with the proposed Battery of the Nation and Marinus Link Projects. In addition, BOWE’s green
                        energy will be available for the Bell Bay Hydrogen Hub.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        BOWE will progress through the licencing process as set out in the recently released Offshore
                        Electricity Infrastructure Bill 2021.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With BOWE, Tasmania will lead the nation in delivering green energy solutions that will help
                        Australia reach and exceed its emissions reduction targets.
